DESCRIPTION
       Vim  is a text editor that is upwards compatible to Vi.  It can be
       used to edit all kinds of plain text.  It is especially useful for
       editing programs.

       There  are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo, multi
       windows and buffers, syntax highlighting,  command  line  editing,
       filename  completion,  on-line  help, visual selection, etc..  See
       ":help vi_diff.txt" for a summary of the differences  between  Vim
       and Vi.

       While  running  Vim a lot of help can be obtained from the on-line
       help system, with the ":help" command.  See the ON-LINE HELP  sec?
       tion below.

       Most often Vim is started to edit a single file with the command

            vim file

       More generally Vim is started with:

            vim [options] [filelist]

       If  the  filelist  is missing, the editor will start with an empty
       buffer.  Otherwise exactly one out of the following  four  may  be
       used to choose one or more files to be edited.

       file ..     A  list  of filenames.  The first one will be the cur?
                   rent file and read into the buffer.  The  cursor  will
                   be  positioned  on  the first line of the buffer.  You
                   can get to the other files with the  ":next"  command.
                   To  edit  a  file that starts with a dash, precede the
                   filelist with "--".

       -           The file to edit is read  from  stdin.   Commands  are
                   read from stderr, which should be a TTY.

       -t {tag}    The  file  to  edit  and  the  initial cursor position
                   depends on a "tag", a sort of goto  label.   {tag}  is
                   looked  up  in  the  tags  file,  the  associated file
                   becomes the current file and the associated command is
                   executed.   Mostly  this  is  used  for C programs, in
                   which case {tag} could be a function name.  The effect
                   is  that the file containing that function becomes the
                   current file and the cursor is positioned on the start
                   of the function.  See ":help tag-commands".

       -q [errorfile]
                   Start  in quickFix mode.  The file [errorfile] is read
                   and the first error is displayed.  If  [errorfile]  is
                   omitted, the filename is obtained from the 'errorfile'
                   option  (defaults  to  "AztecC.Err"  for  the   Amiga,
                   "errors.err" on other systems).  Further errors can be
                   jumped to with the ":cn" command.  See  ":help  quick?
                   fix".


ON-LINE HELP
       Type ":help" in Vim to get started.  Type ":help subject"  to  get
       help  on  a specific subject.  For example: ":help ZZ" to get help
       for the "ZZ" command.  Use <Tab> and CTRL-D to  complete  subjects
       (":help  cmdline-completion").   Tags are present to jump from one
       place to another (sort of hypertext links, see ":help").  All doc?
       umentation  files  can  be  viewed in this way, for example ":help
       syntax.txt".


AUTHOR
       Most  of  Vim  was made by Bram Moolenaar, with a lot of help from
       others.  See ":help credits" in Vim.  Vim  Vim  Vim
       Vim is based on Stevie, worked on by: Tim Thompson,  Tony  Andrews
       and  G.R. (Fred) Walter.  Although hardly any of the original code
       remains.
